# EchoLedger Prototype

EchoLedger is a decentralized utility for timestamping and registering original ideas on the blockchain. It enables users to log their concepts as tamper-proof entries, optionally minting a token that reflects their submission.

## 🔍 What It Is

- A digital notary-like service for idea registration
- A public utility built with transparency, privacy, and decentralization in mind
- A prototype implementation using Python (FastAPI), React, wallet integration (MetaMask and burner wallets), and Fly.io for deployment

## 🚫 What It Is Not

- Not a financial product
- Not a marketplace or intellectual property registry
- Not legal proof of authorship or ownership on its own

## 🎯 Project Intent

EchoLedger is designed as an open-source tool for:
- Claiming a timestamped record of your idea on-chain
- Encouraging a culture of intellectual contribution without requiring legal or institutional mediation
- Exploring how Web3 and verifiable credentials can be repurposed for creative autonomy

While currently free and experimental, the system may later introduce:
- A small user fee to sustain infrastructure and operations
- A monetary token model tied to submission volume or network activity

## 🧑‍💻 Developer Notes

- This project is in active development.
- Structure is designed to remain clean and adaptable.
- Admin access is being built using GitHub OAuth and optional email/password fallback.

## ⚠️ Legal & Ethical Considerations

- This is a *utility*, not a marketplace or financial platform.
- The token minted during registration currently has **no intrinsic monetary value**.
- If tokens gain value in the future, appropriate legal and regulatory processes will be followed.
- EchoLedger makes no guarantees about protecting intellectual property; it simply provides immutable proof that an idea was submitted at a certain point in time.

## 🔐 Licensing

- Source code is released under the standard open source license included in this repository.
- Attribution is required if the project is reused or repurposed.
- This license may be revised as the project matures.
